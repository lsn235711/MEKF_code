# Multi-environment Knockoff Filter
This repository contains the code to reproduce the numerical results in our paper: **Multi-environment conditional independence testing with knockoffs**.

## Folders
* MEKF/: contains the main functions that implement the multi-environment knockoff filter for consistency testing, partial consistency testing and transfer learning.
* examples/: contains examples that demonstrate the usage of the functions.
* experiments/: contains the code to reproduce the numerical results in our paper.
* results_ukb/: contains list of consistent discoveries for UK Biobank phenotypes, at different levels of resolution.
